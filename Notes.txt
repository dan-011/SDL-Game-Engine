Create a component for timer callbacks (inherits from component)
COMPONENTS should be anything in the scene
Scenes should always inherit from Scene and Component
Scenes should add themselves as components

We want a class for all visual items. It will have a position, layer, and support rendering.
We also want to make a collisio
Visual Items (creating a visual item adds it to the manager):
	- Rect
	- line
	- Pixel
	- Sprite -> sprites have pointers to rendered textures
		- AnimatedSprite
	- ViewPort
	- Text

CollisionShapes (support a method to show the shape):
	- Rectangle
	- Circle
	- Elipse

GameManager:
- supports rendering everything
- contains a dictionary for all visual items

Scene:
- Can be played
- contain components

TextureManager:
- static member
- renders all textures to VRAM at launch
- associates file paths to textures
